# QR Menu APP

QR Menu is a web application where users can list products and categories. Users with admin privileges can log in via the "/admin" URL and perform basic CRUD operations such as adding, editing, and deleting categories and products. The application is developed using Firebase and React, ensuring reliability and performance. Additionally, the "forgot password" option is also integrated using Firebase. The design is fully responsive, created entirely with Tailwind CSS.
